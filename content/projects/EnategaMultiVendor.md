Itâ€™s basically a clone of Foodpanda with some inspirations taken from Uber Eats and GrubHub. This product includes 3 Mobile Apps (Rider, Customer & Restaurant), Admin Dashboard, Analytics Dashboard & API Server. It's a full-fledged solution with everything you might need out of the box for making your own food delivery app clone.
